# Thermodinamics-simulations
In this repository will be stored and explained detail 3 different simulations related to thermodynamics. In concrete, we will focus in the study of general thermodynamic systems like ideal gas and Lennard-Jones fluid.

The present work here is uniquely done by David and Andrea (apart form the simulations extracted from its creators who are recognized in each file)
